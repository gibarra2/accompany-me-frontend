# Acompáñame

Acompáñame (accompany me) is a web app where users can collaborate with others to plan group vacations.

Users can create accounts, create trips including other users, and add places to visit for their trips. On their trip pages, users can view a map with markers for every location they plan to visit. This can help users group activities which are geographically close together. Furthermore, users can build out their itineraries, which are then visualized as a timeline on their trip page.

Acompáñame was created as a capstone project for Ada Developers Academy.

This repository holds the frontend code. The back end repository is [accompany-me](https://github.com/gibarra2/accompany-me).
